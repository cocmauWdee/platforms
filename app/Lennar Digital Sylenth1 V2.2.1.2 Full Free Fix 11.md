## What is Lennar Digital Sylenth1 v2.2.1.2?
 
Lennar Digital Sylenth1 v2.2.1.2 is a virtual analog VSTi synthesizer that can run on Windows and Mac operating systems. It is compatible with most DAWs, such as FL Studio, Ableton Live, Cubase, Logic Pro, and more.
 
Lennar Digital Sylenth1 v2.2.1.2 has a simple and intuitive graphical interface that consists of four main sections: the Part Section, the Main Section, the Modulation Section, and the Master Effects Section.
 
- The Part Section contains two identical parts (Part A and Part B), each with four unison oscillators that generate analog shaped waveforms, two filter sections with nonlinear saturation, an amplitude envelope, and a panning control.
- The Main Section contains a filter panel with two global filters that can be used in serial or parallel mode, a mixer panel that allows you to adjust the volume and balance of each part, and a master volume control.
- The Modulation Section contains two ADSR envelopes and two LFOs that can be used to modulate various parameters of the synth, such as pitch, cutoff, resonance, volume, panning, etc. You can also use other sources of modulation, such as velocity, keyboard track, or modulation wheel.
- The Master Effects Section contains seven professional quality sound effects that can be applied to the synth output: an arpeggiator, a distortion unit, a phaser unit, a chorus/flanger unit, an equalizer unit, a delay unit, and a reverb unit.

Lennar Digital Sylenth1 v2.2.1.2 can produce up to 32 voices per note in full stereo mode, which means you can play up to 512 voices simultaneously with 16 notes of polyphony. This makes it suitable for creating rich and complex sounds that can fill up your mix.
