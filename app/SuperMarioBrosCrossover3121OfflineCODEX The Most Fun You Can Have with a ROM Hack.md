Super Mario Bros. Crossover is a fan-made game that recreates the original Super Mario Bros. with characters from other classic Nintendo games, such as Mega Man, Link, Samus, Simon Belmont, and more. The game was created by Exploding Rabbit and released online in 2010. However, in 2022, the online version of the game was removed from the Exploding Rabbit website, making it inaccessible for many fans.
 
Luckily, there is a way to play Super Mario Bros. Crossover offline with CODEX, a group of hackers who crack and distribute video games for free. CODEX has released a modified version of Super Mario Bros. Crossover 3.1.21 that works without internet connection and has some extra features, such as unlocked cheats and fullscreen mode. The game can also be customized with different skins and music.
